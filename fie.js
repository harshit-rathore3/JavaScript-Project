// Readability:
// 1. The code uses descriptive variable names like 'count', 'name', 'PI', 'MAX_SIZE', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'result', 'globalVariable', 'flag', 'status', 'apiKey', and 'maxRetries', which improve the overall readability.
// 2. The code follows a consistent formatting and indentation style, making it easy to understand the structure and flow of the program.

// Efficiency:
// 1. The code does not contain any obvious performance issues or inefficient algorithms.
// 2. The calculations performed, such as adding 'a' and 'b' or multiplying 'x' and 'y', are straightforward and efficient.

// Modularity:
// 1. The code is organized into variables and functions, which helps to separate concerns and improve modularity.
// 2. The 'greet' function is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be easily reused or tested.

// Extensibility:
// 1. The code uses modern JavaScript syntax, including 'let' and 'const' declarations, which promote flexibility and maintainability.
// 2. The use of global variables, such as 'globalVariable', may limit extensibility, as they can lead to naming conflicts and make the code harder to refactor in the future.

// Best Practices:
// 1. The code follows established JavaScript best practices, such as using camelCase for variable and function names, and using 'const' for variables that are not meant to be reassigned.
// 2. The code could be further improved by adding more comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the different sections.
