// Readability:
// 1. The code uses descriptive variable names like 'count', 'name', 'PI', 'MAX_SIZE', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'result', 'globalVariable', 'flag', 'status', 'apiKey', and 'maxRetries', which improve the overall readability.
// 2. The code follows a consistent formatting and indentation style, making it easy to understand the structure and flow of the program.

// Efficiency:
// 1. The code does not contain any obvious performance issues or inefficient algorithms.
// 2. The calculations performed, such as adding 'a' and 'b' or multiplying 'x' and 'y', are straightforward and efficient.

// Modularity:
// 1. The code is organized into variables and functions, which helps to separate concerns and improve modularity.
// 2. The 'greet' function is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be easily reused or tested.

// Extensibility:
// 1. The use of variables and functions makes it relatively easy to add new features or modify existing functionality.
// 2. The use of 'let' and 'const' for variable declarations promotes better code maintainability and extensibility.

// Best Practices:
// 1. The code follows the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) syntax, including the use of 'let' and 'const' for variable declarations.
// 2. The code adheres to the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which is a widely adopted and respected set of best practices for JavaScript development.
