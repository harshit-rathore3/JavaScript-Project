// Readability:
// 1. The code uses descriptive variable names like 'count', 'name', 'PI', 'MAX_SIZE', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'result', 'globalVariable', 'flag', 'status', 'apiKey', and 'maxRetries', which improve the overall readability.
// 2. The code follows a consistent formatting and indentation style, making it easy to understand.

// Efficiency:
// 1. The code does not contain any obvious performance issues or inefficient algorithms.
// 2. The calculations performed, such as addition and multiplication, are straightforward and efficient.

// Modularity:
// 1. The code is organized into variables and functions, which promotes modularity and separation of concerns.
// 2. The use of global variables and functions could be improved by encapsulating them within a module or object.

// Extensibility:
// 1. The code is relatively simple and does not demonstrate any advanced design patterns or principles that would promote extensibility.
// 2. The use of constants like 'apiKey' and 'maxRetries' suggests the potential for future extensibility, but the overall structure could be improved.

// Best Practices:
// 1. The code follows the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) syntax, including the use of 'let' and 'const' for variable declarations.
// 2. The code could be further improved by following the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for enhanced readability and maintainability.
