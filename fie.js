// Readability:
// 1. The code uses descriptive variable names like 'count', 'name', 'PI', 'MAX_SIZE', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'result', 'globalVariable', 'flag', 'status', 'apiKey', and 'maxRetries', which improve the overall readability.
// 2. The code follows a consistent formatting and indentation style, making it easy to understand the structure and flow of the program.

// Efficiency:
// 1. The code does not contain any obvious performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms.
// 2. The calculations and operations performed are straightforward and efficient.

// Modularity:
// 1. The code is organized into variables and functions, which helps to separate concerns and improve modularity.
// 2. The use of global variables and functions could be improved by encapsulating them within a module or object.

// Extensibility:
// 1. The code is relatively simple and does not demonstrate any advanced design patterns or principles that would promote extensibility.
// 2. Introducing a more modular and object-oriented approach could enhance the extensibility of the codebase.

// Best Practices:
// 1. The code follows the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) syntax, including the use of 'let' and 'const' for variable declarations.
// 2. The code adheres to the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which is a widely-adopted set of best practices for JavaScript development.
