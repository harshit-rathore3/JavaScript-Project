// Readability:
// 1. The code uses descriptive variable names like 'count', 'name', 'PI', 'MAX_SIZE', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'result', 'globalVariable', 'flag', 'status', 'apiKey', and 'maxRetries', which improve the overall readability.
// 2. The code follows a consistent formatting and indentation style, making it easy to understand the structure and flow of the program.

// Efficiency:
// 1. The code does not contain any obvious performance issues or inefficient algorithms.
// 2. The calculations performed, such as adding 'a' and 'b' or multiplying 'x' and 'y', are straightforward and efficient.

// Modularity:
// 1. The code is organized into variables and functions, which helps to separate concerns and improve modularity.
// 2. The 'greet' function is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be easily reused or tested.

// Extensibility:
// 1. The code uses a mix of 'var' and 'let' declarations, which allows for both global and block-scoped variables, providing flexibility for future modifications.
// 2. The use of 'const' for 'apiKey' and 'maxRetries' ensures that these values cannot be accidentally modified, promoting code stability and maintainability.

// Best Practices:
// 1. The code follows common JavaScript conventions, such as camelCase for variable and function names, and the use of semicolons to terminate statements.
// 2. The code includes comments to explain the purpose of certain variables and the overall structure of the program, which can be helpful for future developers working on the codebase.
