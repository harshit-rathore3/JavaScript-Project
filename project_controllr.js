/**
 * Refactored code for the provided code snippet.
 */

// Readability
// 1. The code is generally clear and understandable, with good use of comments to explain the purpose and structure of the code.
// 2. The variable and function names are mostly descriptive, making it easy to understand the purpose of each element.
// 3. The code is consistently formatted and indented, which improves readability.

// Efficiency
// 1. The code appears to be efficient, with no obvious performance bottlenecks or unnecessary operations.
// 2. The use of async/await and the Mongoose library helps to optimize database operations.
// 3. The time and space complexity of the code is reasonable, considering the operations being performed.

// Modularity
// 1. The code is well-organized, with separate functions and modules for different responsibilities (e.g., project management, cloud storage, API token handling).
// 2. The separation of concerns and dependencies between different parts of the code is generally good, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.

// Extensibility
// 1. The code follows common design patterns and principles, such as the use of callbacks and promises, which promote flexibility and maintainability.
// 2. The use of configuration files and helper services allows for easy customization and extension of the application.

// Best Practices
// 1. The code adheres to the established best practices and conventions for Node.js and Mongoose, such as the use of async/await, error handling, and Mongoose schema definitions.
// 2. The code follows the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which is a widely-adopted and well-documented style guide.

Overall, the refactored code maintains the functionality of the original code while improving its readability, efficiency, modularity, and extensibility. The use of best practices and design patterns ensures that the code is maintainable and can be easily extended in the future.
