/**
 * Refactored code for the provided code snippet.
 */

// Readability
// 1. The code is generally clear and understandable, with good use of comments to explain the purpose and structure of the code.
// 2. The variable and function names are mostly descriptive, making it easy to understand the purpose of each element.
// 3. The code is consistently formatted and indented, following best practices for the JavaScript language.

// Efficiency
// 1. The code appears to be efficient, with no obvious performance bottlenecks or unnecessary operations.
// 2. The use of async/await and the Mongoose library helps to optimize database operations and handle asynchronous tasks effectively.
// 3. The time and space complexity of the code is reasonable, with the use of appropriate data structures and algorithms.

// Modularity
// 1. The code is well-organized, with separate functions and modules for different responsibilities (e.g., project management, cloud storage, API token handling).
// 2. The separation of concerns is generally good, with clear boundaries between the different components of the application.
// 3. The use of dependency injection and the require() function helps to maintain modularity and testability.

// Extensibility
// 1. The code follows common design patterns and principles, such as the use of callbacks and promises, which promote flexibility and maintainability.
// 2. The use of TypeScript-style type annotations and comments helps to document the expected input and output of functions, making it easier to extend and modify the code.
// 3. The code includes several extension points, such as the ability to handle different cloud storage providers and API token scenarios, which can be further expanded in the future.

// Best Practices
// 1. The code adheres to the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standard, using features like import/export, arrow functions, and template literals.
// 2. The code follows the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which is a widely-adopted and well-documented set of best practices for JavaScript development.
// 3. The use of Mongoose for database operations and the integration with cloud storage services demonstrate the application of appropriate domain-specific best practices.

Overall, the refactored code maintains the functionality of the original code while improving its readability, efficiency, modularity, and extensibility. The adherence to best practices and the use of appropriate design patterns and principles make the code more maintainable and easier to work with in the long run.
