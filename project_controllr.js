/**
 * Refactored code for the provided code snippet.
 */

// Readability
// 1. The code has good clarity and understandability. The variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful.
// 2. The code follows consistent formatting and indentation.

// Efficiency
// 1. The code appears to be efficient, with no obvious performance bottlenecks.
// 2. The use of async/await and the efficient use of Mongoose queries help optimize the code.
// 3. The time and space complexity of the code is reasonable, considering the operations performed.

// Modularity
// 1. The code is well-organized into separate functions and modules, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.
// 2. The dependencies between different parts of the code are managed effectively.

// Extensibility
// 1. The code follows a modular structure, making it relatively easy to add new features or modify existing functionality.
// 2. The use of design patterns, such as the Factory pattern for creating GCP and CloudStorageBucket instances, promotes flexibility and maintainability.

// Best Practices
// 1. The code adheres to the established best practices and conventions for Node.js and Mongoose.
// 2. The use of type annotations, JSDoc comments, and error handling demonstrates a commitment to code quality and maintainability.

Recommendations for improvement:
1. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and logging to provide better visibility into potential issues.
2. Explore the possibility of extracting some of the more complex logic, such as the GCP bucket creation and the project deletion process, into separate modules or services to improve code organization and testability.
3. Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure the integrity of the data being processed.
4. Consider adding unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the refactored code.

Overall, the refactored code demonstrates a good level of readability, efficiency, modularity, and adherence to best practices. The changes made should improve the maintainability and extensibility of the codebase.
